Exercise 3
=================================================================

Newton-Raphson method
----------------------
           
  - We are now going to use the Newton-Raphson method to find for the square root of points between 0 and 20
  - Remember that NR is a method to find the zeroes of a function
  - We have to re-write our problem as: y2 - x = 0
  - Our goal is to find the zeros of the function f(y)= y2 - x for a given x 

Task: calculate and print on a grid of 100 points between 0.2 and 20, with the built-in function sqrt(x) and with NR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Again, we are just focusing on the qualitative features
  - Remember the maths: for f(y) = y2 - x, f'(y) = 2y
  - Start with 4 iterations, the starting point might be set to x

-----------------------------

  - Then increase the number of iterations one by one
  - How many iterations are necessary to reproduce the square root with a precision to 10-14?
