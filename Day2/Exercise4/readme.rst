Exercise 4
=================================================================

Fast inverse square root
------------------------

  - We are now going to use the binary representation to calculate y = 1/sqrt(x)
  - The results will be refined with one or two iterations of the Newton-Raphson (NR) method
  - In the sqrt.c file you have write the algorithm discussed in the lecture in the appropriate space
  - Run it first without any NR iteration
  - Then add one and two iterations

------------

  - How is the accuracy increasing? The execution time?
